								</p>
								<p>Dear delegates,
									It is my pleasure to welcome you to the Human Rights Council at La Martiniere Calcutta Model United Nations 2014. The topic for discussion is multi-faceted and intriguing, one I personally find extremely tricky to handle –
									“Human Trafficking with special emphasis on Bonded Labour”
									Human Trafficking is currently the most rampant international black-market trade. Almost every country in the world is affected by trafficking, whether as a country of origin, transit or destination for victims. In 2008, the United Nations estimated nearly 2.5 million people from 127 different countries were being trafficked into 137 countries around the world. 
									</p><p>
									The committee will be very solution–based but keep in mind that each country has a different humanitarian situation from the others. These differences have to be discussed before concrete solutions can be formulated, as what may be beneficial in one country, might be detrimental in another. 
									Now, we come to your board. Aparimita Das, your director, is not only an avid and experienced MUN-ner and debater, but she also plays golf and tennis. She has an exhaustive list of talents but she manages to balance them out evenly, excelling in everything she wants to do. As for me, I am a Commerce student with a keen interest in a medley of things, some of which are poetry, photography, psychology, manga and philosophy. I have a personal fondness for bad puns, and bad jokes in general, but do not bring up any of the above when committee is in session. That will not be ‘pun’-ny. 
									 </p>
									<p>
									Delegates, conclusively, we expect detailed research on the agenda, encompassing all the facets of the issue at hand. Abiding by one’s country policy is also imperative, but negotiation will be looked upon favourably by the board. Since it is a controversial issue, I encourage you all to explore unconventional solutions.  </p> <p>
									We are working extremely hard and hope that you’re as excited as we are. We look forward to meeting you all in May and we’d love to hear from you so feel free to contact us if you have any questions. </p> 
									<p>
									Thanking you,
									</p><p>
									Yours truly, </p>
									<br><p>

                                <h3>Topic Area Summary</h3>
								<p><em>Agenda: Human Trafficking with special emphasis on Bonded Labour</em></p>
								<p>Human trafficking, as defined in the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, is the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons done by threat or use of force, coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or vulnerability, or giving payments or benefits to a person in control of the victim. Women and children are common victims of Human Trafficking, with about half of all people trafficked worldwide being children. Some of the countries in which Human Trafficking occur at alarming rates are Bangladesh, Haiti, Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Uganda, Ghana and China.</p>

								<p>Human trafficking is a market-driven criminal industry that is based on the principles of demand and supply. It is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by social, economic, cultural and other factors, of which, most make people vulnerable to human trafficking. However, human trafficking does not exist solely due to people vulnerable to exploitation. It is instead, fuelled by a demand for cheap labour or services, or for commercial sex acts. There are other factors as well that tend to be common to trafficking in general or found in a wide range of different regions, patterns or cases. </p>

								<p>Human Trafficking is carried out for the purpose of exploitation. It is the most rampant international black-market trade currently. According to the United Nations, there are more than 2.4 million victims of human trafficking, out of which 80 percent are being sexually exploited. Annually, there is a $32 billion profit in the black market, earned solely through human trafficking. </p>
								<p>Work in this industry includes using the victims for prostitution and other involuntary practises. Bonded labour, or debt bondage, is probably the least known form of labour trafficking today, and yet it is the most widely used method of enslaving people. A person becomes a bonded labourer when their labour is demanded as a means of repayment for a loan. The person is then tricked or trapped into working for very little or no pay, often for hours on end. Exploitation isn’t limited to these two aspects. It also includes organ trafficking, illegal adoption, slavery, use of children in warfare, and so on. </p>

								<p>While there is degradation in the state of humanitarian affairs due to human trafficking, the economic impact cannot be discounted either. There is a major loss in human resource for the country of origin which could’ve otherwise, been trained into a professional task force. The rehabilitation of the victims of human trafficking is also an expensive and delicate affair, further complicated by social stigmas. </p>

								<p>As the Human Rights Council, we will examine the situations faced by various countries and come up with solutions that address a particular situation. Since each country’s humanitarian condition is different, we have to ensure that the solution, while it might be beneficial in one country, is not detrimental in another nation. Being well-versed with the treaties and charters that govern human rights and human trafficking will stand you in good stead in committee, as well as a thorough knowledge about the initiatives in place that deal with human trafficking. Human trafficking, as previously mentioned is a complex issue, and its facets aren’t very savoury but an evil that exists, is an evil that needs to be eradicated. Delegates, the bare skeleton of the topic lies before you. It is in your hands to understand and debate the lives of thousands of people- people who don’t know better. Here lies before you an opportunity to take a look at the darker side of life, find some very unpleasant answers, and hopefully, formulate an effective solution. </p></p>

                                    <p>The Human Rights Council is an inter-governmental body within the United Nations responsible for the promotion and protection of all human rights. The Human Rights Council will be convening to discuss human trafficking in persons, with special emphasis on bonded labour. Human trafficking can be divided into two broad categories- sex trafficking and labour trafficking. Bonded labour or debt bondage can be categorized under labour trafficking. As a part of LMCMUN, we will be debating the intricacies of this illegal trade and exploitation. With millions across the globe suffering as victims, delegates will need to devise a solution that will protect the human rights of all those involved. The delegates will have to strive to maneuver a fine line between what is right and what is justice- the complexities are difficult to deal with objectively when there are entire livelihoods dependent on the decisions made. </p>
