								<p>Dear delegates,
								It is my pleasure to welcome you, to what promises to be one of the most dynamic and challenging committees being simulated at this year’s session of LMCMUN. Delegates will be taken back to the years of the Cold War where national propaganda And a race for supremacy between the conflicting capitalist and communist ideologies were at its peak. Our committee shall be discussing the “Space Race”, a race for supremacy in space exploration and the possibilities of militarization of space, a frontier mankind has yet to conquer. And you as diplomats will be tasked with turning around this phenomenon to the best interests of the international community and help the world enter an era of détente. This committee shall be a constant crisis committee, so I cannot stress on how important it is, that delegates be extremely familiar with their country policies, as well as quick on their feet because you will be thrown into the most unpredictable and engaging of crises.</p>
								<p>
								Now coming to your executive board, I’m an 11th Grade student studying Science and Mathematics. As far as my MUN experience is concerned I have had a record of attending several Historic Security Councils representing a variety of countries like Kuwait, China and France, and have served as rapporteur for the United States National Security Council at LMCMUN 2013. Although I enjoy theatre and public speaking in general, above everything I’m an extremely avid manga and anime enthusiast and plan on pursuing a career in animation in the near future. Your Director is DevdeepDatta Gupta. Like me, he's also an 11th grade student in the science stream. He too has attended several reputed MUNs such as HMUN and has won accolades in nearly all of them. He was on the executive board of the Special Summit on Syria which was simulated at LMCMUN 2013. Apart from MUN he is also an avid sports person, who has represented the State at the National Championships in Rowing as well as Equestrian. He’s also the captain of the West Bengal Junior Rowing team. Amidst all this he also find the time to be a talented golfer and swimmer. He plans on studying Computer Science or Aeronautical Engineering in the future.</p> <p>
								Detailed and technical research, especially beyond country policies and into the specifics of rocket technology and the indigenous space programs at the time will undoubtedly give you an edge above others in this committee. I look forward to an intense 3 days of committee, but amidst all the debate and argument please remembers delegates, to have an enjoyable experience.</p>
								<p>
								Yours faithfully,
								</p><p>

                                <h3>Topic Area Summary</h3>
								<p><em>Agenda: The "Space Race" with emphasis on the issue of militarization of space.</em></p>
						<p>The roots of the Space Race can be traced back to as early as 1930 when Lieutenant Colonel Karl Emil Becker of Germany called for development of artillery systems to bypass the treaty of Versailles ban on cannon development. This led to the research and construction of several advanced booster systems resulting in the A-4 and eventually the infamous V-2 Rocket which could be launched at supersonic speeds. This technology gave Germany the upper hand many a times during the Second World War Post-war the United States conducted Operation Paperclip and captured several of these German aeronautical and missile technology experts such as Wernher Von Braun and V-2 models, whilst the Soviet took control of the rocket base at Peenemünde led by chief spacecraft engineer Sergei Korolev; and thus the stage was set for the Space Race. The space race officially began on 30th August when the United States as well as the Soviet Union began constructing ballistic missiles that could be utilized to send equipment material into space. This was a decade fraught with launch failures and fierce competition between the superpowers, neither willing to lose out to the other in any way. Although the USSR did seem to be in the lead for the first few years with launching the first orbiting satellite as well as sending the first automated manned spacecraft into orbit as well, the United States escalated things further by commencing the final stage of the Space Race or the Moon race. Kennedy realizing the urgency of surpassing the Soviets in the frontier of space stood before Congress in 1961 and stated “this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before the decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth.” This gave rise to rash attempts at achieving the aforementioned goal by both the Soviets as well as the Americans. Soon the failures were piling up and so were the deaths, and these were being pushed under the rug only to be disclosed several years later. In USSR, Engineers reported 200 design faults with their rocket system to party leaders, but their concerns "were overruled by political pressures for a series of space feats to mark the anniversary of Lenin's birthday.“ And although on the face of it, this entire situation seemed merely a technological race between the Apollo and Soyuz programs, in reality it was much more multifaceted. </p>
						<p>Since the rocket propulsion systems have their roots in missile technology, the world may be heading towards an era where ICBMs can be constructed having more accuracy than ever before with the additional capability of carrying destructive warheads, several folds more dangerous than the primitive V-2. Also with the increased research in nuclear technology one can’t help but be wary of the threats the Space Race poses. In addition the increased satellite surveillance, the drain of the space programs on the countries’ economy, and the involvement and impact of these developments on other countries are other aspects that must be kept in mind. Committee shall begin on March 1967, post several of the launch failures and the impending stalling of both space programs. The Security Council must make note of the large number of casualties and the unbridled rashness of the actions of both parties and must deliberate upon measures to ensure the continuity of scientific progress but not at the cost of human resources and possibilities of development of deadlier forms of weaponry. Above it must be ensured that space remains a neutral frontier free of conflict.</p>

                                    <p>The Security Council is the primary organ of the United Nations, assigned with the responsibility of maintaining International peace and Security and also resolving issues and disputes in a peaceful and feasible manner. A Historic Security Council is a meeting of the Security Council set in the past. The purpose of such a committee is to change the course of history, obviously for the betterment of mankind. Under the charter its many functions range from investigating any dispute or situation which might lead to international friction to taking military action against an aggressor. This year at LMCMUN, we shall be deliberating upon whether the Space Race of the 1950s threatens to open the doors to new threats, such as militarization of space. At the same time delegates should strive to use the situation to its maximum potential and help the world enter a new scientific era while easing political tensions.</p>
