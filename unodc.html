								<p>Delegates, it is an honour for me to welcome you to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. This committee guarantees to be stimulating, challenging and dynamic in it's own way. That being said, it should be an experience worth remembering and that will only be possible with your contribution. Delegates will be debating and discussing the situation currently existing in West African nations with respect to rising drug trafficking and subsequent narco-terrorism that poses immense threat to the smooth governance, law and order as well as the economic well-being of these nations. </p><p>
								West Africa is growing to become one of the leading hubs for trafficking of drugs and other crimes arising out of it. Violence, political instability, crashing economies have become the standard practice in these countries, some of which barely enjoying proper administration or even an organised government. With the help and co-operation of the world community, the Office on Drugs and Crime looks to reduce the stronghold of smugglers, traffickers, cartels or even smaller groups that actively engage in illicit drug trade. The issue of unemployment has caused many to fall back upon this drug trade for their livelihood. If we are to prevent drug trafficking and narco-terrorism from destroying these nations beyond repair then we must look at multi-dimensional solutions, original and creative thinking will go a long way in a delegate's evaluation. Coming to your executive board : </p>
								<p>
								I’m currently an 11th Grade student pursuing Humanities and Math. I’m a very passionate debater and have represented my school in several debates around the nation. I’m also a part of my school aquatics team. I’m a hardcore Manchester United fan so feel free to approach me during breaks in committee with any football related talk. I may come across as quite serious at times but a little amount of fun is always in order. </p> <p>
								Your directors are Aditya Sarkar and Andre Jaggi. Aditya is an avid debater, MUN'ner', trekker, coldplay enthusiast and a nerd. Currently studying Commerce, he wishes to pursue law for his higher studies, having a keen eye for Indian politics and International law. Having a passion for dramatics, expect some melodramatic debate when he's around. </p> <p>
								Andre is a robust, friendly individual who is currently studying humanities in class 11, and too hopes to pursue law in the future. His terrible sense of humour coupled with his calm demeanour make him a highly approachable and likeable person. A football enthusiast and voracious reader, Andre will ensure that committee will never be static or ever lack entertainment. </p><p>
								Delegates are advised to have detailed research, not only on their own country's policies and the specifics of drug trafficking and narco-terrorism in all West African nations but also and overview of these crimes in other parts of the world. Transnational crimes of such magnitude have no boundaries, which calls for more intense and fiery debate among member nations. Delegates must be able to think on their feet, be innovative in their approach and should be confident of their actions in committee. I truly hope that this will be a worthwhile experience for each and every one of you and I guarantee that the executive board will work to achieve that goal.<p>
								<p>
								Best wishes,
								</p><p>

							<p>Topic : Drug trafficking and narco-terrorism in West Africa</p>
							<p> The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime plays a leading role around the world in curbing and preventing illicit drug trade as well as narco-terrorism arising out of it, that has expanded exponentially over the past few decades and is potent in several regions such as Latin America, Afghanistan and in recent times even West Africa. West Africa, home to 16 nations is no exception in experiencing both of these potent and dangerous forms of transnational crime. The region is soon becoming the epicenter of drug trafficking and narco-terrorism which has deteriorated the governance there. In less than one and a half decades West Africa has become a major transit and repacking hub for cocaine and heroin flowing from the Latin American and Asian producing areas to European markets. Drug trafficking reached unprecedented levels in the mid-2000s as a result of a growing European market.  Steps have also been taken by the traffickers to make West Africa self-sufficient in illicit drug production providing another major avenue of profit for the drug traffickers. West Africa is truly experiencing a form of transnational crime that affects the entire globe; from the forests of Myanmar to the streets of Mexico, no nation is an exception to the repercussions of the rise of drug trafficking in West Africa which poses one of the gravest threats to the world community. West Africa presents an ideal choice as a transit center for drug traffickers; its geography and law enforcement make detection difficult, the region boasts well-established networks of smugglers and crime syndicates, and a vulnerable and volatile socio-political environment creates major opportunities for operation while causing the risk factor to be diminished to negligible rates. There exists great political instability in the region with weak and poorly funded administrative institutions emerging as a result. Due to destabilization and war in the region, organized crime has become paramount and with the presence of corrupt government, military, and police officials, has in some cases led to partial State dependence on narcotics trafficking. The institutional corruption has also led to the weakening of state border protection, allowing international crime organizations, especially drug cartels to establish connections in the region and deal with local rebel, guerrilla, and militia groups causing rising violence and tumult to be accompanied with the already major problem of drug trafficking. These conditions have naturally allowed terrorist organizations, both from the East and the West as well as those already existing in the region, to actively prevail in this region. Increasing links between the drug traffickers and the terrorists have given rise to a new form of security threat in the region : narco-terrorism. A term coined by President Fernando Belaúnde Terry of Peru in 1983,narcoterrorism is understood to mean the attempts of narcotics traffickers to influence the policies of a government or a society through violence and intimidation, and to hinder the enforcement of anti-drug laws by the systematic threat or use of such violence. The definition also entails the funding of terrorist groups through engaging in drug trafficking activities.  A deadly combination of terrorist groups and corrupt local leaders is turning West Africa into one of the world’s leading narco-trade routes with alliances being formed between terrorist organizations such as Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Hezbollah, FARC and the West African drug traffickers. The drug trafficking situation has festered to form the grave threat of narco-terrorism. The world community must tackle this long neglected issue speedily and end it permanently before it convolutes into something even more dangerous. The international community is now faced with the task of preventing West Africa to grow into a larger transnational hub for such illicit activities, while allowing each nation in the region to develop independently. </p>

                                    <p>The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) set up in 1997 to assist the UN in addressing a coordinated, comprehensive response to the interrelated issues of illicit trafficking in and abuse of drugs, crime prevention and criminal justice, international terrorism, and political corruption. The UNODC works towards ensuring not only a solution to this festering problem of drug trafficking around the world, but also must look at preventing terrorism and ensuring relief for victims of these atrocities. Therefore this year at LMCMUN, we look to host a committee on Drug Trafficking, which falls under the mandate of the topics of the Office on Drugs and Crime. We focus on the region of West Africa, which today, is arguably the most potent route for the transportation and sale of illicit drugs around the world. Not only do we look to prevent the drug trafficking, but also the terrorism that is largely funded by this said trafficking, commonly known as Narco-terrorism. When a region such as this, must succumb to the claws of organized crime, it is our actions that can change the course of their history. </p>
