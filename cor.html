								<p>Dear delegates,
								 It is with great pleasure that I welcome you to what will be one of the most intense and incendiary committees being simulated at LMCMUN 2014. This year we will be convening an emergency plenary meeting of various heads of terrorist organizations who will come together to express their stance on the liberation of Afghanistan and numerous Middle Eastern countries. The premise of this committee is to bring out the subjectivity of right and wrong and show the power religion wields in various volatile Islamic nations. Delegates will be put into a situation where they will have to forge a different perspective on the War on Terror also referred to as Operation “Uniting for Freedom”. The delegates of this committee will have to face a unique predicament- they will have to form alliances with the very people they are at odds with over diverging ideologies. The pivot of this committee is to form a united front against the despotism of the western world, while remaining well grounded in reality. Since this committee will be a constant crisis committee, the delegates will have to be well versed in the objectives and the creed of their respective organizations. Threats and challenges will evolve continually and hence delegates will be tested on their skills to improvise and reconcile radically different beliefs. Debate will be more complicated by the tumult of the situation and the attempts of the USA to delay their withdrawal.</p><p>
								Now coming to your executive board; I am an 11th grade student studying Humanities, and I have an avid interest in History and Political Science. I’m a voracious reader and my other interests include debating, eating good food, and watching sitcoms. MUN has been an integral part of my school life for the past few years, and my experience ranges from being a delegate in committees like the League of Arab States at LMCMUN 2012 to Historic Security Councils to vice-chairing the WTO at IIMUN. I feel it is my passion for history and international affairs that makes me an enthusiastic participant at MUNs regardless of the agenda.</p>
								<p>
								Your director, Misam Hashmi, is a 10th grade science student who is looking to have a career in Biology. She has a unique and avid interest in football which overshadows her other interests such as listening to good music and reading. Her erratic nature will ensure that committee is lively and dynamic. She is a seasoned MUNer, having been delegate at the League of Arab States and an executive board member at the General Assembly- SOCHUM at LMCMUN 2013. Roshni Chakraborty, the Assistant Director is a student of class 9 who actively pursues debating, quizzing and MUNning. She is a skilled piano player, an avid reader and she also enjoys football. Your rapporteur, Meghna Bahry, is a student of class 9. Apart from Model United nations she actively pursues writing, debating, elocution, photography and would like to have a career in psychology and cognitive science. </p> <p>
								This committee is the first of its kind and shall have its own specialized procedure which shall be elaborated upon in the study guide. Along with this a special guide on the personality portfolios shall be uploaded in due time to help you understand the dynamics of the person you will be emulating. Delegates, do not hesitate to think out of the box, but keep in mind that the proposed solutions must be applicable. It is for this committee to form realistic solutions, establish a status quo and demarcate areas of control.</p> 
								<p>
								I look forward to 3 days of constructive debate. 
								<p>
								<p>
								Yours faithfully,
								</p><p>

                                <h3>Topic Area Summary</h3>
								<p><em>Agenda: Liberation and resurgence of the Middle East and Afghanistan, post 2014 </em></p>
							<p>In the wake of 9/11, America declared that its war on terror would begin with the eradication of the Al-Qaeda, and it would not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated. The creation of an “outside enemy” has served to hide the real economic and strategic objectives behind the war in the Middle East and Afghanistan. Waged on the grounds of self-defence, the pre-emptive war is upheld as a “just war” with a humanitarian mandate. </p>
							<p>From the outset of the Soviet-Afghan war in the early 1980s, the US intelligence apparatus supported the formation of the “Islamic brigades”. Ironically, Al Qaeda –the “outside enemy of America”- as well as the alleged architect of the 9/11 attacks, is a creation of the CIA. The US intelligence apparatus has created its own terrorist organizations. And at the same time, it creates its own terrorist warnings concerning the terrorist organizations. Meanwhile, a cohesive multibillion dollar counterterrorism program “to go after” these terrorist organizations is put in place. </p>
							<p>Despite the declarations of American leaders that the Al-Qaeda is a spent force, the ideology of global jihad that they espoused will not disappear quickly, for it has taken root in far too many Muslim fringe groups. In the aftermath of the Arab Spring, when people’s movements overthrew dictatorships in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, the biggest challenge faced by nascent states and the USA was to ensure that terrorist organizations do not penetrate into these societies or in any way determine their political future. The prominent fear is that terrorists could return on the backs of fledgling Islamic parties. These volatile Islamic nations are fragile, not only because of what might happen there politically but also because of what it can foster elsewhere.</p>
							<p>The war in Afghanistan has continued for 13 years, exhausting the USA and its allies. After a decade the NATO has achieved none of its aims: rebuilding the Afghan state, defeating various organisations such as the Taliban, Al-Qaeda and Haqqani network, and stabilizing the region. On paper, NATO has 2 million troops under arms, but it can provide for and equip only 40,000 to continue in Afghanistan; and yet they are in talks with the Afghani government to extend the time for withdrawal or make provisions for a US presence, post 2014.  
							The Taliban insurgency is more intense than ever, Afghani government is weaker than ever, and the Middle East lacks proper relations with USA. Hence, the task of true liberation and resurgence falls to the people who run this parallel underground government. </p> 
							<p>What will the future of war ravaged Afghanistan be? Is the creation of a pan-Islamic nation with its foundation in Sharia law in its purest unadultered form a truly utopian idea? Can the Middle Eastern region, Afghanistan and Pakistan be assured a safe future from the tyranny of an imposed democracy? If the West is to depart from Afghanistan by 2014, then who, or which organization will fill the political void that will be left in the wake of the NATO withdrawal from Afghanistan? Finding solutions to these problems is the purpose of this confederacy. </p>
							<p><em>Please note that the delegates applying for this committee will have to submit an additional special application which will be uploaded to this page shortly. We will not be judging the applications solely on the basis of experience; the content of your answers will be taken into account.</em></p>
