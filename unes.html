								<p>Dear delegates, Welcome to the ‘United Nations Emergency Summit’ at LMCMUN 2014 - a futuristic committee set in a society that is slowly turning dystopic. The delegates, as some of the most powerful people, find it upon themselves to restore peace and international security. However, the most powerful people seldom harbour the same interests. A difficulty then arises when they must put their individual interests aside as well as consider the interests of the masses in order to realize a goal much greater than the individual. </p><p>
								As the committee’s chairperson, I understand that some of you will be first timers and some with years of experience behind you. The good thing about MUN is that it presents a rather gradual learning curve. LMCMUN 2014 aims at making you compete with yourselves and your peers but more importantly it aims to be an enriching learning experience for everyone.  Though this committee does expect to see a very high level of debate, I hope that the competition does not cloud the more meaningful aspects of an MUN. Winning an award at an MUN may be of value to you, but it is more important that you grow from this committee as a person. Whether you come to this committee as a novice or a master, I will do everything I can to ensure that you leave with memories that last you a lifetime.  </p>
								<p>
								The committee’s director, Ayan Sarkar, is one of the most humble and genuine people I have had the pleasure of knowing. Ayan is currently in the twelfth grade studying humanities. Besides being a hardcore gamer and an avid football fan, he plans to study Law or Economics in the future. Ayan and I have been friends for quite a long time and have even been in various MUN committees together. As for myself, I am a twelfth grade student with varied interests that range from music and food to mathematics, psychology and metacognition. Despite this, I spend most of my time on Computer Science, my most ardent passion. Put very simply - I love to code. </p> <p>
								Please do not hesitate to contact either me or Ayan on the email listed below if you have any questions about preparing for committee or if you just want to get in touch! I wish all of you luck in your preparation for this committee, and look forward to meeting you all. </p> 
								<p>
								Best wishes,
								</p><p>

                                <h3>Topic Area Summary</h3>
								<p>To whomsoever it may concern,</p>

								<p><em>"The aim of the High is to remain where they are. The aim of the Middle is to change places with the High. The aim of the Low, when they have an aim—for it is an abiding characteristic of the Low that they are too much crushed by drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious of anything outside their daily lives—is to abolish all distinctions and create a society in which all men shall be equal." - George Orwell, 1984. </em></p>

								<p>Peace and international security - the two ideological pillars that keep the United Nations standing are slowly beginning to crack. How, you might ask? The details were too much for this mere invitation letter. Besides, it would be dangerous to intimate you about such classified information in such a manner over such an insecure network. The grip of power has wavered away from the clutches of governments into the claws of individuals. The reason you read this is that you are one such individual. The United Nations values the influence you exert over people. The ability to prevent absolute anarchy now lies in your hands.</p>

								<p>You are not alone, however. You are a mere part of the small group of individuals, each of whom with his or her own incentives. Beware. You are a member of “the High”, but “the Middle” is watching your every move, eagerly waiting for you to fumble. One little gaffe and all your prestige will wane. The concerns of “the Low” must not be ignored either. Always remember, they are responsible for putting you where you are, and they are responsible for keeping you there.</p>

								<p>There is only so much that can be revealed in this letter. I hope it has been enough to arouse your interest. The United Nations cannot compel you to accept this invitation - the choice is absolutely yours. Do keep in mind, crises are imminent. Safety is no guarantee. Accepting to attend this summit puts your life in grave danger. But it is important that you realize that this is all for a cause much greater than any individual. </p>

								<p>Regards, <br>
								Chairperson.</p>

                                    <p>The United Nations Emergency Summit’s purpose is to allow the United Nations to continue its ideals of maintaining international peace and security in a dystopian world. The masses are rapidly losing all faith in the United Nations and there is turmoil all over the world. The United Nations Emergency Summit aims to bring together elite leaders from industry and finance, politics and government, and academia for semi-formal discussions about major issues which the world faces and regain the trust of the populace.</p>
