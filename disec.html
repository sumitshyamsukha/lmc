																<p>Dear delegates,
								We welcome you to what will be the most exciting and enthralling committee being simulated at LMCMUN 2014, the DISEC. The DISEC is one of the most important committees of the UN. We hope that you as delegates will feel the impact of the committee as it will be discussing the most relevant issues in today's world.</p><p>
								Delegates, as we know, the world today is precariously balanced and constantly threatens to engulf us into another world war. Whether it is unwanted nuclear proliferation or illegal weaponry, it is for the DISEC to prevent it and decide the future for this world. As a part of the DISEC, you have been given the responsibility to ensure that peace precedes aggression. </p>
								<p>
								The committee will be co-chaired by us, Meha Jhajharia and Akshara Parul. We are in the twelfth grade, and are with the sciences. We've been team-mates since we were little and so we stand here again. Even though we are Biology students we are passionate about the Humanitarian disciplines and spend most of our classes debating over world wars, literature, poetry and music. </p> <p>
								Meha is one of the most aggressive debators you will ever meet, however her soft side is reflected by her love for art and Harry Potter. She loves animals, especially whales and aspires to save each one of them around the world. </p> <p>
								Outside committee, Akshara is a fun and extremely energetic person whose laugh, if not the jokes, will prevent you from keeping a straight face. She is a national level basketball player who gives her all for the sport. Shanika Bhowmick is your director, however calm she may appear--well appearances do deceive. She is currently in the tenth grade. She is extremely dedicated and focussed in whatever she chooses to do. </p><p>
								Delegates, we expect you to be well-researched as the study-guide merely demarcates the different aspects of the agenda. As members of the DISEC, you must reach a solution that satisfies and does justice to the situation at hand. We look forward to three days of active and intense debate over the most pertinent issues in the world today. We as young minds should do as much as we can to strive towards a better world. Above all, enjoy the experience!<p>
								<p>
								Please feel free to contact us if you have any queries.

								Yours truly,
								<br><p>
								Meha Jhajharia <br>
								Akshara Parul <br>
								Chairpersons of the First Committee, the Disarmament and International Security Committee.

                                <h3>Topic Area Summary</h3>
								<p><em>TOPIC A: Effective arms control and prevention of black arms trade.</em> <br>
								<p>Black arms trade, also called gunrunning, is the illegal smuggling of weapons or ammunition. The constitution of legal trade in firearms varies extensively, depending on local and national laws. Existing committees, treaties and conventions for disarmament, arms control and the black market haven't proved to be viable or very productive for the international community. As a result, this needs to be focussed upon as it’s repercussions could very well be extremely destructive. Illegal small arms trade has not only caused a chain of non-state actors to come together but has also become a major threat to the governments of the respective countries. Areas of the Middle-East, Caribbean as well as South America are well under the umbrella of these illicit trade relations. The Middle East, being the oil reservoir of the world, is an area to be protected, not only from terrorists organizations and revolutionaries but also from these illegal trade relations. Border conflicts have led to the further weakening of security which contribute to these trade relations flourishing.</p>
								<p>Another aspect is the armament policy being followed by several nations. This leads to an arms race that eventually destabilizes entire regions and leads to distrust and war between nations. The militarization and weaponization of outer space is an important aspect here and needs to be given special attention. The policy of military propaganda for the promotion of arms sales, missile development and world military spending, all contributes to and highlights the need for an effective and lasting agreement amongst nations.</p>
								
								<p><em>TOPIC B: Creation of an international protocol to-</em> <br>

								<em>i] Monitor the nuclear developments of nations and the nuclear co-operation between nations.</em> <br>

								<em>ii] Prevent Non-State actors from undertaking nuclear proliferation.</em> <br></p>

								<p>The threat of a 'World War III' constantly knocks on the doors of peace. The nuclear developments and armament around the world is a leading reason for this. Resolutions and treaties have been passed previously to prevent nuclear proliferation however none of them have been completely successful. The situation in Iran as well as North Korea testifies to this. As members of the DISEC, we believe that this committee has to come up with Strict and Concrete solutions for this. If nuclear war were to occur, it would mean the mutual destruction of all involved parties. Therefore, it is imperative for the DISEC to prevent such a disaster from taking place. </p>
								<p>We will be focussing on the trade, weaponry and nuclear developments made by non-state actors, as they do not come under any state-jurisdiction and stand as a major threat to the world. A non-state actor is an individual or organization that has significant political influence but is not allied to any particular country or state. Nuclear development and black arms trade are co related and is a major topic of discussion. If these weapons--that can cause immense damage--were to fall into the wrong hands, the future of the world would be destroyed.  The DISEC will be looking forward to solutions for the near future. </p>
								<p>It is now up to us, as the First Committee of the United Nations, to ensure that the magnitude of destructive tools and love for power does not destroy the peace the world has been striving—so very hard—to achieve. </p></p>

                                    <p>DISEC is one of the first and the principal bodies of the United Nations. It is responsible for maintaining world peace and security. It is the first of the six General Assemblies and with all 193 members of the UN. The ideas and simulations discussed and presented at DISEC is quite wide spread and reflect how countries and organizations work together towards a better tomorrow. The world today is precariously balanced and constantly threatens to engulf us into another world war. Whether it is unwanted nuclear proliferation or illegal weaponry, it is for the DISEC to prevent it and decide the future for this world. The mandate of DISEC can range from forging peace treaties to recommending armed intervention, allowing the committee to have a major say in every notable conflict since the creation of the UN.</p>
