									<p>- Earl Warren</p>
								</p>
																<p>Dear delegates,
								It is my singular privilege to welcome you to Legal, the Sixth Committee of the General Assembly, at La Martiniere Calcutta Model United Nations 2014.</p><p>
								The Legal Committee, being responsible for the codification and progressive development of international law, is one of the most significant committees in the United Nations. What makes this committee so important is that it forms the very essential framework for the functioning of all other committees and in achieving the objectives of UN amidst the challenges of the 21st century. </p>
								<p>
								I, your Chairperson, am an 11th grade science student with a proclivity for the arts. Apart from being passionate about MUN, my other interests include debating, music, theatre, and film-making. Like every average Indian, I relish food, enjoy playing cricket and hold very strong opinions regarding international affairs, and more specifically, Indian politics. </p> <p>
								Your Director, Souradeep Bhattacharya, is a fellow 11th grade science student. Apart from being an ardent MUNner, he is also a brilliant quizzer, a voracious reader, a movie buff and a gaming enthusiast. Being extremely aware of current affairs, he always happens to know the answer to any question you might ask him. Armed with his spontaneity and inane sense of humour, he will surely make your experience at LMCMUN a memorable one.</p> <p>
								Being in such a committee will undoubtedly challenge you; not only will you have to be well-versed on country policy, but also have to justify your decisions within the core principles of international law and its intricacies. The two agenda chosen are ones that involve highly conflicting stances and deal with a plethora of issues of relevance to the international community today.  As delegates in this committee, you will have to take a pragmatic stand and strive towards building consensus in establishing legal standards on issues that have divided the international community and polarized great minds for ages. Remember delegates, the smallest steps you take will have giant repercussions for your respective countries. The ramifications of your decisions will impact generations to come. The responsibilities are immense. Be decisive. Be emphatic. Be all that you want our leaders to be. </p><p>
								This committee expects nothing short of passionate debate, clever diplomacy and intense lobbying. The Legal Committee promises to be an unparalleled experience and we, at LMCMUN, will leave no stone unturned to ensure that these 3 days of conference are etched in your memory for years to come.<p>
								<p>
								Regards,
								</p><p>

                                <h3>Topic Area Summary</h3>
								<p><em>Topic 1: “The Scope and Application of Universal Jurisdiction”</em>
							<p>Universal jurisdiction is a legal doctrine which permits domestic courts to initiate criminal proceedings against perpetrators of some crimes, so heinous, that they may be regarded as crimes against the entire human race. Being an application of extraterritorial jurisdiction, this obligation arises regardless of whether the perpetrator (or victim) may be of alien nationality and may have no direct connection with the prosecuting state. The crimes subject to universal jurisdiction, under customary international norm, include crimes against humanity, war crimes, torture, genocide, piracy and slavery.  </p>
							<p>States have always taken interest in the goings-on of their international counterparts, and especially in modern times, with states feeling an obligation to uphold the standards of the Responsibility to Protect, they have found ways to legally involve themselves in the perceived human rights malfeasances of other states. Be it the Nuremberg Trials post WWII, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and former Yugoslavia, or the more recent case of Chile and Augusto Pinochet in 1998, universal jurisdiction is a principle that has become increasingly essential in establishing a more effective judicial system globally.</p>
							<p>Proponents of Universal Jurisdiction argue that this policy is necessary to ensure international accountability and it further serves as a preventative mechanism against potential human rights violations. Critics of Universal Jurisdiction argue that the policy violates the gold-standard world principle of national sovereignty and in such a domesticated approach to global justice, mala fide political interests may seep in undetected and the processes followed during prosecution, may not be fully consistent with international legal norms. However, the main problem with Universal Jurisdiction is that there is no formal legal basis for it; it has the drawback of lacking uniformity in definition across nations and having ambiguity and inconsistency in its application.</p>

							<p>With this increasing trend in the implementation of Universal Jurisdiction, it is clear that the international importance is looming. Universal jurisdiction holds out the promise of greater justice, but the jurisprudence of universal jurisdiction is disparate, disjointed and poorly understood. So long as that remains so, this weapon against impunity is potentially beset by incoherence, confusion, and, at times, uneven justice. It is the need of the hour that the Legal Committee discusses this issue in terms of the modern milieu of global political culture and, overcoming the knotty political and legal hurdles, establishes clear legal standards to make it a genuinely equitable and effective system of international law.</p>

							<p><em>Topic 2: “Defining Legal Standards for International Intervention and Peacekeeping”</em></p>

							<p>International intervention may be defined as an intentional act of one state or group of states or an international agency aimed at exercising overriding authority on what are normally the “internal” policies or practices of another sovereign state, so as to considerably influence the domestic affairs of that state. Intervention can be broadly classified into military intervention and non-military; the latter including economic, diplomatic and the like. This committee will primarily focus on armed intervention which, in terms of international law, is the threat or use of force by one country in the internal or external affairs of another.</p>

							<p>An intervention is usually carried out in times of extreme conflict; most commonly to arbitrate a dispute or prevent widespread violation of human rights. It goes without saying that international intervention definitely forms an intrinsic facet of 21st century politics; as evidenced by the state of affairs in countries around the world, be it Iraq, the Koreas, Mali or the Middle East. The foremost problem when it comes to settling disputes of this nature resides in the fact that there are no proper legal standards governing the application of this principle. There are many questions that have to be answered before such a task may be undertaken; on whether consent is required for intervention, on the dubious concept of unilateral intervention without any international consensus or on whether the concept of intervention is only a pretext for concealed strategic motives as many allege. Delegates in this committee must also evaluate the role of UN peacekeepers in the light of the UN’s role as an entity in facilitating intervention. Delegates should consider standards of discipline and conduct that are crucial to effective deployment of any peacekeeping force.</p>

							<p>While some admit to the grain of truth in the slogan, “If you want peace, prepare for war,” others argue, the surer path to a more tranquil world is to prepare for peace directly.</p>

							<p>International intervention and peacekeeping are matters that dominate international discourse yet remain contentious and unresolved. In light of recent events, the need to craft legal standards for such intervention appears to be more compelling than ever before. Taking a decisive stance is essential in closing the book on a multitude of issues plaguing the world today.  This topic will push delegates to consider the forces that  drive international political discourse. Alliances will be formed, broken and betrayed as the Legal Committee at LMCMUN 2014 collectively attempts to put a full stop to one of today’s greatest quandaries.</p></p>

                                    <p>The Sixth Committee of the General Assembly, being responsible for the codification and progressive development of international law, is one of the most significant committee in the United Nations. The Legal Committee is broadly authorised to elaborate new treaties on the widest range of legal issues, to adopt them and to recommend them to Member-States for their subsequent ratification and accession. The Legal Committee at LMCMUN 2014 will discuss two extremely important and politically contentious issues. The first agenda for consideration is “The Scope and Application of Universal Jurisdiction”. Universal jurisdiction, an application of the principle of jus cogens, is a legal doctrine which permits domestic courts to initiate criminal proceedings, extra-territorially, against perpetrators of an alien nationality. With states feeling the responsibility to uphold justice globally, universal jurisdiction has become an essential tool to ensure international accountability and prevent potential malfeasances. The second agenda is the “Defining Legal Standards for International Intervention and Peacekeeping”. International intervention and peacekeeping are matters that dominate international discourse yet remain contentious and unresolved. There are many questions that have to be answered before such a task may be undertaken; on whether consent is required for intervention, on the dubious concept of unilateral intervention without any international consensus or on whether the concept of intervention is only a pretext for concealed strategic motives as many allege. </p>
